objective-curl.framework

This is my attempt at bringing an easy-to-use libcurl interface to Cocoa developers. My first and foremost efforts are focusing primarily on recursive FTP upload and download support. There are a couple frameworks out there for libcurl, though I found myself unsatisfied with them each for different reasons. Some lacking functionality, out of date or unstable. I am actively working on this (almost daily) to bring it up to speed. If you would like to contribute please email me - nickrjensen [at] gmail [dot] com
